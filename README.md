## Requirements

* CocoaPods (or Rubygems if you are to install CocoaPods)
* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) version 7.1 or higher
* A tvOS compatible device for usage (however, only Xcode is required for simulation)

## Getting Started

To install CocoaPods on your Mac, run the following line using the terminal:
```sh
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Navigate to your `tvOS-app/` folder your terminal and type:
```sh
$ pod install
```

This will create a file called `NarrativePlay.xcworkspace`, that can be opened with Xcode

## Usage

Launch the app by selecting your device of choice in the Xcode toolbar

If you want to deploy it on a tvOS-device, you have to connect it to your computer via USB first
Otherwise, you can select a simulated Apple TV device.

Click on the "Play" button to build and run the project

Navigate using the Apple TV remote, or simulated remote, and discover Narrative Moments.
